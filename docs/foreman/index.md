# Overview: Foreman

Choosing an orchestrator often forces you to compromise. Many tools are Python-first, leaving your Go or C# teams feeling like second-class citizens. Worse, many cloud platforms require you to upload your proprietary code and data just to run a workflow.

Foreman is the language-agnostic orchestrator that respects your stack and your security. It's a full-featured workflow engine that runs in your environment. You configure your DAGs, triggers, and container events from our clean dashboard, but your code and data never leave your control.

It’s the professional-grade orchestration you need, built to work with your stack, not the other way around.
