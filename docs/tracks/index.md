# Overview: Tracks

Feature flags are essential for modern development, but they have a hidden cost: massive tech debt. Devs add flags, product teams flip them on, and then everyone forgets, leaving your codebase littered with dead, 'always-on' code.

Tracks is the feature flag system designed to solve the tech debt problem. It gives you full visibility into every flag, identifying which ones are stale, which haven't been used in months, and exactly where your tech debt is hiding.

More importantly, it integrates with Jira and Trello, so your product and dev teams can see the status of every flag and create cleanup tickets right from the dashboard. It’s a professional tool for shipping features and keeping your code clean.
