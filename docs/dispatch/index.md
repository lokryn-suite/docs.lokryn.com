# Overview: Dispatch

Dispatch is a real-time notification component you can drop into any website to send in-app messages and track user interactions.

It provides a complete "bell icon" notification system that handles:
* Fetching notifications for a user and their groups
* Displaying an unread-count badge
* Marking messages as "read"
* Handling user events like "accept" or "dismiss"
