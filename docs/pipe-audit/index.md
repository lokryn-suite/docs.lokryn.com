# Overview: Pipe Audit

Pipe Audit is the umbrella project that brings together the **CLI**, **Core library**, and **Contributing guides**.  
It provides compliance-ready developer tools for building, testing, and extending audit workflows.

## 📖 What you'll find here

- [**CLI**](./cli/index) — The command-line interface (`pipa`) for running audits and managing contracts.
- [**Core**](./core/index) — The foundational library (`pipa-core`) with contracts, profiles, rules, and modules.
- [**Contributing**](./contributing/index) — How to extend Pipe Audit with new providers, rules, and documentation.

## 💡 Tip
If you’re new to Pipe Audit, start with the [CLI Quickstart](./cli/quickstart).  
If you’re exploring the internals, head to the [Core Modules](./core/modules/core-modules).  
And if you want to contribute, check out the [Contributing guide](./contributing/index).
