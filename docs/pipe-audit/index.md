# Pipe Audit

Pipe Audit is the umbrella project that brings together the **CLI**, **Core library**, and **Contributing guides**.  
It provides complianceâ€‘ready developer tools for building, testing, and extending audit workflows.

## ðŸ“– What you'll find here

- [CLI](/docs/cli) â€” the commandâ€‘line interface (`pipa`) for running audits and managing contracts.
- [Core](/docs/core) â€” the foundational library (`pipa-core`) with contracts, profiles, rules, and modules.
- [Contributing](/docs/contributing) â€” how to extend Pipe Audit with new providers, rules, and documentation.

## ðŸ’¡ Tip
If youâ€™re new to Pipe Audit, start with the [CLI Quickstart](/docs/cli/quickstart).  
If youâ€™re exploring the internals, head to the [Core Modules](/docs/core/modules).  
And if you want to contribute, check out the [Contributing guide](/docs/contributing).
