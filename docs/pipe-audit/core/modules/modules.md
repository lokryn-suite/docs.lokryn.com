# Core Modules

The `pipa-core` crate exposes a curated set of public modules that provide a stable API surface for programmatic use.  
This page serves as an overview — use the sidebar to explore each module in detail.

## Available Modules

- [`contract`](./contract)  
  Manage contracts: list, validate, and run validations programmatically.

- [`profile`](./profile)  
  Work with connection profiles: list and test profile definitions.

- [`run`](./run)  
  Execute contract validations directly without going through the CLI.

- [`logs`](./logs)  
  Verify and manage tamper‑evident audit logs.

- [`health`](./health)  
  Run system health checks to validate environment and connectors.

- [`init`](./init)  
  Scaffold a new project programmatically (e.g., config files, directories).
