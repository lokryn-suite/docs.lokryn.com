# Pipe Audit

**Pipe Audit** is an open‑source data quality engine written in Rust.  
It provides both a **command‑line interface (CLI)** for end‑to‑end workflows and a **core library** for programmatic integration.

## Why Pipe Audit?

- **Validate data contracts** to ensure files meet expected schemas and rules
- **Profile‑aware connectors** for moving and validating files across systems
- **Tamper‑evident audit logs** with cryptographic sealing and verification
- **Extensible architecture**: add new validators, connectors, or profiles without breaking existing workflows

## Components

- **CLI (`pipa`)**  
  Quick project scaffolding, contract runs, profiles, logs, and health checks.  
  → [CLI Quickstart](./cli/quickstart)

- **Core Library (`pipa-core`)**  
  Reusable Rust API for contracts, profiles, validators, connectors, and audit logging.  
  → [Core Architecture](./core/architecture)

## Get Started

- [Installation](./installation)
- [Contracts Overview](./contracts/overview)
