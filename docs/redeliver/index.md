# Overview: Redeliver

Missed callbacks are more than an annoyance—they're a silent business killer. One network glitch and you could lose a critical webhook. Worse, trying to replay them later often breaks the sequence, charging a customer for a subscription before it was even created.

Redeliver is your solution for guaranteed webhook reliability. It's an API gateway that intercepts and secures every callback you receive. If your endpoint is down, it doesn't matter. You get a full dashboard to see, manage, and replay any individual missed event.

The real power? You can replay the last 'N' days of callbacks in the exact order they were received, giving you professional-grade peace of mind without having to build a complex queuing system yourself.
