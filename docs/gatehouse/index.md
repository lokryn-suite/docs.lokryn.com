# Overview: Gatehouse

Setting up secure auth is a huge barrier for small teams. You're forced to choose between building it yourself, which is risky, or buying an enterprise solution that charges you for bloated features you'll never use, like SAML.

Gatehouse is the professional alternative. It's a modern auth service that gives you the expert-level features you actually need—like passwordless login and MFA—at a budget-friendly price.

And since it uses Flight Recorder internally, you automatically get a full compliance trace for every single auth event. It’s the enterprise-grade security you need, without the enterprise overhead.
