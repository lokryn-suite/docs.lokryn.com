# Overview: Flight Recorder

For small software teams, scattered logs are more than a hassle—they're a compliance nightmare waiting to happen. But small businesses need professional tools, not enterprise overhead.

That's why we built Flight Recorder. It's your self-hosted logging system in a simple Docker container, so you always control your data. It gives your team a clean dashboard and fast queries for easy debugging.

When you're ready to scale or pass a SOC 2 audit, the paid version adds tamper-proof logs and a high-speed data lakehouse for custom SQL. It’s the expert-level tool you need, priced for the value you get.
