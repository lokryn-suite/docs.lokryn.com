# Control Room Quickstart

This guide will walk you through signing up and finding your way around the Control Room.

## 1. Signing Up & Logging In

There are two ways to get an account:

* **If you are the first user (Org Admin):**
    1.  Navigate to the main [Lokryn sign-up page](https://www.lokryn.com/signup).
    2.  Register your account and create a new organization. You will become the administrator for this org.
* **If you are joining an existing organization:**
    1.  You must receive an **invitation email** from your organization's administrator.
    2.  Click the link in the invite to create your account and join the team.

Once your account is set up, you can log in from your organization's login page.

## 2. The Main Dashboard

When you log in, you'll land on the main dashboard. This is your central hub for two key things:

1.  **Viewing Stats:** You'll see high-level statistics and activity for all your products.
2.  **Activating Products:** This is where you can sign up for the **free tier** of any product (like Dispatch, Flight Recorder, etc.) to get started.

## 3. Managing Your Organization

The **main navigation menu on the left** is where you handle all administrative tasks.

* **Products:** Once activated, this is where you'll find the dedicated dashboards for each product.
* **Organization:** Manage your organization's name and settings.
* **Team:** Invite new users to join your organization.
* **Billing:** Manage your subscription, payment methods, and view billing history.
