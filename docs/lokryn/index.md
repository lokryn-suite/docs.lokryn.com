## Why Marketplaces?

Lokryn avoids “yet another SaaS platform” by delivering strictly through AWS Marketplace, the Shopify App Store, and API marketplaces.

- **Security**: AWS tools run inside your VPC. Your data never touches our servers.  
- **Simplicity**: Shopify apps install with one click. No complex integrations or IT support needed.  
- **Focus**: 100% on code quality and developer experience, and 0% on overhead and bloat.
