# ✅ **Affiliate Ping – FAQ**

When an order uses a tracked discount code, Affiliate Ping sends an instant alert to your chosen channel:

- **Email**  
- **Slack (via webhook)**  

Notifications include order details, the code used, and the influencer/partner associated with it.

2. Go to your storefront  
3. Add a product to the cart

All changes take effect immediately.
