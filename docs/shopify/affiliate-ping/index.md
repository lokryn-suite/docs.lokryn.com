# Affiliate Ping

Get instant notifications when your influencer and partner discount codes drive sales.

Affiliate Ping monitors your Shopify store for orders that use tracked discount codes and instantly notifies you via email or Slack. Know the moment a partner's code converts—no more digging through reports.
